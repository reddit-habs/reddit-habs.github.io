Welcome to nhlapi's documentation!
==================================
This documentation is for the programmatic Python API. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP clients.
It also offers a few objects that make it easier to interact with the API, such as :class:`nhlapi.utils.Season`.

To get complete information about the NHL API consult `dword4's docs`_.
